# configuration.php is kind of generic, but Joomla doesn't have any common # files between the 1.5 branch and the 2.5.X or 3.X branches. Otherwise we could # happily use the joomla.xml file which comes with the 2.5 and 3.X branches of Joomla
# FIXME egrep might not be necessary. None of my test Joomla 2.5/3.X sites had a configuration.php I think they should, once the site is up and running, but my test sites were basically unzips of # the Joomla download and not an actual install.
